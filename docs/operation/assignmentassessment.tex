\section{Assignment Assessment}

We felt the assignment was a bit short. Since we had a lot of people
already familiar with UNIX-based operating systems, and had managed
small scale email-systems using both postfix and exim, we had little to
no problems configuring a working email infrastructure. However, we
still learned a lot on how to plan and document the system, something
none of us had any in-depth knowledge about from before. 

Perhaps an idea for the next assignment would be to hand over the system
to another group, documentation and all, and have them give remarks on
our documentation, what is good, what isn't, how would they have done
things differently etc. This would be a good learning tool...

Anders stilte kritiske spørsmål som hjalp oss å reflektere.
