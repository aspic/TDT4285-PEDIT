\section{System description}
This section describes the different components used to fulfill and execute the planning phase. We will briefly mention the software and protocols used, and how they are integrated into the server.

\subsection{Software}
The following software was used to create our Email service.
\subsubsection{Exim}
Exim, our SMTP server, was installed through apt-get and it had a simple 'plug-and-play' installation guide. There was some automatization and configuration issues regarding standardizing the defualt port: We were not able to use port 25, which is the default outgoing port for any mail service, NTNU has disabled this port. \\
We choose to use NTNU's mailgateway \emph{mailgw.ntnu.no} for our outgoing port, rather then using a custom port through \emph{tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no} because .. \\
A consequence of this will be that the user will have to specify the outgoing port in their Email client manually, then rather using the defualt adress \empth{tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no:25}. But, since port 25 would have never worked in the first place, it was inevitable that some client-side configuration was necessary.

\subsubsection{Dovecot}
Dovecot, our IMAP server, was already installed with the lastest version on the server when we started the implementation. This proved not be an issues because Dovecot is a simple 'plug-and-play' application that operates seamlessly with the server. \\
We were able to use the default port 143 for incoming mail, in any Email client by connecting to the server with: \emph{username@tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no:143}.


\subsection{Protocols}
\subsubsection{IMAP}
Internet message access protocol (IMAP) is the standard protocol for mail retrieval which is implemented in the application layer. It has a simple set of messages and commands that can be sent and recieved between the client-application and the email server. These messages and commands allows a client to remotely access email on an email server by provding a valid username and password.

\subsubsection{SMTP}
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) handles mail submissions by the client and makes them accessible to the recieving client to retrive it via the IMAP protocol. It uses several intermediate server to complete this processes, including a mail submission agent (MSA) server and a mail transfer agent (MTA).
