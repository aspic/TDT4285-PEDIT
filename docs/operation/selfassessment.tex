%What would you have done dif-
%ferently if you were to do it all over again? How did
%teamwork and communication, both intra- and inter-
%group, turn out?


The communication within the group worked well enough, but could of course have been even better. The group have communicated using mail, IRC and during group meetings. 
There have been a total of two group meetings during the operation phase, however some of the group members where not available to join the meetings. 
The second meeting was planned during the first meeting, so the group member that was not present at the first meeting was not aware of the second meeting, and was thus not present there either. This could have been done a lot better. 

The group have had only a little communication with other groups, through IRC, when necessary. This was mostly regarding root access to the server.
