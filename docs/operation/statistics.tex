\section{Statistics}
This section describes the statistics gathered from Exim, patterns we
found in those statistics, and what conclusions we can gather from that
data.

Exim records all statistics regarding it operation in the logfiles
located in \emph{/var/log/mainlog}. Exim has a built in tool to gather
those statistics, namely \emph{eximstats}.\\\\
Figure~\ref{fig:mailperhour}  describes the amount of email processed (sent
and received) during the different hours of the days. This is highly
relevant in order to pick a good time for maintenance. However, as is
visible from the table, a email server that is always active is
difficult to maintain without interrupting the users. The reason for
this is a periodic script sending mail to the OS-group, we believe.

  \label{fig:rejection}
\end{figure}
As an operator it's interesting to know why a particular email did not
reach it's destination. Figure~\ref{fig:rejection} describes the
different reasons for rejection and lists how many individual emails
that were the reason for these rejections. As we can derive from the
figure, a total of 8 mails were rejected due to relay permissions. We
believe the cause of this is misconfiguration of one or more
IMAP-clients.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:amount} describes the amount of email per day. From the
straight and coherent lines showing the sent and received statistics we
can deduct that all mail was probably sent and received by the same
server, i.e. the users of this particular email system were only
contacting eachother. The error rate is stable and fairly close to
zero.\newline
