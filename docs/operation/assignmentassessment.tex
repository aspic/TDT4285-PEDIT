\section{Assignment Assessment}

We felt the assignment was a bit short. Since we had a lot of people already
familiar with UNIX-based operating systems, and had managed small scale
email-systems using both postfix and exim. This meant that we had little to no
problems configuring a working email infrastructure. However, we still learned a
lot on how to plan and document the system, something none of us had any
in-depth knowledge about from before. 

Perhaps an idea for the next assignment would be to hand over the system to
another group, documentation and all, and have them give remarks on our
documentation, what is good, what isn't, how would they have done things
differently etc. This could also be a good test for the quality of the
documentation, is it understandable for someone that has never touched the
system before? 

We enjoyed the presentation before the implementation phase, where Anders and
Sigurd asked us critical questions, revealing flaws in our proposed solution,
and giving us the opportunity to fix them before the operational phase. 

Overall, we learned a lot about system administration and documentation during
the assignment.
