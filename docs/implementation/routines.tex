\subsection{Setting up Mutt for reading Emails}
Mutt \cite{mutt} is a small but powerful email client for Unix operating systems. Mutt can be used to read and send emails from the server. To set up mutt, do the following:

\item Input \emph{mutt}. This will start Mutt.
\item The first time mutt is started, it will ask you if you want to use Mail as your mailbox.

\end{itemize}
