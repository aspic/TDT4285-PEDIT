\section{Installation process}
This section describes the installation process, what was configured and
what choices we made regarding the setup. This section should serve as a
``stand alone'' guide, that will be sufficient when setting up a
identical system from scratch.
\subsection{Pre-conditions}
The following guide assumes that these conditions has been met:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The server is running Debian Squeeze, installed with the base
system
	\item The acting user has root access
	\item A text editor is installed (we assume Vim)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Install procedure}
This section will describe the installation procedure step by step.
\subsubsection{Exim}
Exim4 is bundled with the base system of Debian Squeeze, hence we only
needed to reconfigure the package configuration file.
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config #Start reconfigure interface
\end{lstlisting}
Through this interface the Exim server will be reconfigured to suit our
needs. Each dialogue (in order will be described below), and what option
we chose will be highlighted. In the first dialogue, press
\emph{OK}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{General type of mail configuration:}\\
By default only local delivery works in Exim. Since we want to
send/receive external mail, and since the mail is sent my the NTNU
gateway, choose: \emph{mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or
fetchmail}.
\item\textbf{System mail name:}\\
Enter \emph{tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no}.
\item\textbf{Exim IP configuration warning}\\
Read through the information and press \emph{OK}.
\item\textbf{Enter IP-address to listen on for incoming SMTP
connections}\\
The IP address can be found in several ways. We execute nslookup:
\begin{lstlisting}
nslookup tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no

Server:		129.241.0.200
Address:	129.241.0.200#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no
Address: 129.241.106.91
\end{lstlisting}
Enter the address the \emph{129.241.106.91}.
\item\textbf{Other destinations for which mail is accepted}\\
Enter \emph{tdt4285.idi.ntnu.no}.
\item\textbf{Machines to relay mail for:}\\
Leave this field empty.
\item\textbf{IP address or host name for the outgoing smarthost:}\\
We need to define the outgoing smarthost for SMTP. Since NTNU has closed
port 25 for outgoing traffic. We will us the main mail gateway which
NTNU provided. Enter \emph{mailgw.ntnu.no}.
\end{enumerate}
