\section{Event Log}
This section describes the events we discovered during the operational
phase.
\subsection{Exim and Dovecot}
We checked the various logs for both Exim and Dovecot. The log for Exim
is located in \begin{verbatim}/var/log/exim4\end{verbatim} and Dovecot
by default logs to \begin{verbatim}/var/log/syslog\end{verbatim}

No huge events were discovered for either Exim or Dovecot after
grepping through the logs. Both systems had been running and functioning
during the operational phase.
\subsection{The general system}
By running ``uptime'' in a shell on the server, the output was
\begin{verbatim}12:43:11 up 43 days, 19:37,  7 users,  load average: 1.28, 1.33, 1.24\end{verbatim}
meaning that the system had not been down during the operational phase.
