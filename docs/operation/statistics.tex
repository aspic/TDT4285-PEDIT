We have also monitored the operation through statistics generated by Exim. The period we monitored spanned from the 7th of March through to the 16th.\newline

The first table (fig. 1) describes the amount of email processed (sent and received) during the different hours of the days. This is highly relevant in order to pick a good time for maintenance. However, as is visible from the table, a email server that is always active is difficult to maintain without interrupting the users.\newline

\end{figure}

As an operator it's interesting to know why a particular email did not reach
it's destination. The second table (fig. 2) describes the different reasons for
rejection and lists how many individual emails were affected.

\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Rejected RCPT: relay not permitted} error means that someone tried to relay mail
using our SMTP server, which is not permitted. This can be caused by someone
using an email-client and using our SMTP server as an outgoing SMTP server
which, according to the SLA, is not permitted.

\item \textbf{SMTP protocol synchronization} error means that something or someone tried to
talk to our SMTP server using a non-spec SMTP protocol implementation. This can
be caused by someone manually telneting to our SMTP server and mess about with
it, or a faulty implementation.

\item \textbf{Rejected RCPT: Unrouteable address} means that the server could find the
specified address, and therefore, could not deliver the email. This error can be
avoided if you want by specifying that all unroutable mail should go to a
specified address, more often than not root@example.com.

The last table (fig. 3) describes the amount of email per day. From the straight and coherent lines showing the sent and received statistics we can deduct that all mail was probably sent and received by the same server, i.e. the users of this particular email system were only contacting eachother. The error rate is stable and fairly close to zero.\newline
